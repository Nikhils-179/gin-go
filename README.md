This project helped me to understand API Development in Golang using Gin Framework. 

To install go and run the application . 
Follow the below steps:

1. install go binaries in the system
2. Create a go repository
3. Set Path to the created repository (No need to set after go 1.18)
4. initialize dependency management run {go mod .}
5. Create repository // Or simply Clone the repo

Happy Development! :)
